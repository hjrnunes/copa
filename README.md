# COPA - Culinary Operating Procedure Adviser

COPA is a Clojure/Clojurescript recipe manager. It is a bit rough around the edges, and it's purpose is mainly for me to learn Clojurescript and related frontend technologies. But, it's a fairly complete example of a Clojure/Clojurescript SPA with an API backend so it might be useful for beginners.

Possibly interesting features to more advanced coders are Markdown support for the recipes and frontend localization in Clojurescript (only English and Portuguese, but trivial to add more).

COPA is based on a [Luminus][1] template.

It's Clojure on the backend with a Swagger API via [compojure-api][2]. Database access via [HugSQL][9] on an H2 database.

Frontend is Clojurescript with [reagent][3] and [re-frame][4]. At one point it also included [re-com][5], but it's now Semantic-UI.

URL based navigation with [pushy][7] and [bidi][8].

Authentication is JWT via [buddy][6].

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][10] 2.0 or above installed.

[10]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Initalization

You'll need to run 
    
    lein migratus
    
to execute the migrations that initialize the H2 database on the backend. 

The H2 database location can be configured in ```profiles.clj``` like this:
 
 ```clojure
 {:profiles/dev  {:env {:database-url "jdbc:h2:./copa;MVCC=true"}}
  :profiles/test {:env {:database-url "jdbc:h2:./copa_test;MVCC=true"}}}
 ```

There should be a default user with which you can login initially: 

```username: admin```

```password: admin```


## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

To start Clojurescript auto-compiling via [figwheel][8], run:

    lein figwheel

## Deploying

Build a uberjar with

    lein uberjar

And then run it with

    java -jar copa.jar

COPA will start on localhost:3000
