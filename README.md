# COPA - Culinary Operating Procedure Adviser

COPA is a Clojure/Clojurescript recipe manager. It is a bit rough around the edges, and it's purpose is mainly for me to learn Clojurescript and related frontend technologies. But it's a fairly complete example of a Clojure/Clojurescript SPA with an API backend so it might be useful for beginners.

Started with a [Luminus][1] template.

It's Clojure on the backend with a Swagger API via [compojure-api][2].

Frontend is Clojurescript with [reagent][3] and [re-frame][4]. At one point it also included [re-com][5], but I since moved to Semantic-UI.

Authentication is JWS via [buddy][6].

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][7] 2.0 or above installed.

You will also need an instance of MongoDB running locally. COPA tries to connect to

    mongodb://localhost/copa

You'll need to manually create the first admin user. On the mongo shell do:

    use copa
    db.users.insert({"username": "your_username", "password": "your_encrypted_password", "admin": true})

You'll need to encrypt the password as Copa encrypts with buddy's default bcrypt+sha512. One way of easily do that is, in your REPL:

```clojure
(require '[buddy.hashers :as h])
(h/encrypt "your password")
=>"bcrypt+sha512$50262d113ba346aa7c3fdd2f3ab0d16c$12$82d784d46bbcba663344865a98129cb30f46bcb5a3912e30"
```

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

To start Clojurescript auto-compiling via [figwheel][8], run:

    lein figwheel

## Deploying

Build a uberjar with

    lein uberjar

And then run it with

    java -jar copa.jar

COPA will start on localhost:3000
